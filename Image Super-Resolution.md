  <details>   
      <summary>Summary</summary>   
       We present Meta-Transfer Learning for Zero-Shot SuperResolution (MZSR), which leverages ZSSR, to adress two problem. One problem is that existing methods cannot exploit internal information within a specific image. Another is that they are applicable only to the specific condition of data that they are supervised.
